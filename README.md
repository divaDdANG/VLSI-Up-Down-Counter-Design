# VLSI-Up-Down-Counter-Design
Developed a fully synchronous binary up/down counter with scan-enabled flip-flops, glitch-free control logic, and timing-optimized datapath; executed complete RTL-to-GDSII flow with Cadence tools (Xcelium, Genus, Conformal, Innovus, Tempus) targeting a 45nm 11-metal technology.
